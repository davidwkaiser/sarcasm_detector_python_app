# Sarcasm Detector App
This webb app uses a model created to classify a text as sarcastic or not.

The model creates a Document Text Matrix (DTM), on which a clasification model is trained to label a comment as sarcastic or not.

Trained and tested on a random sample drawn from a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sherinclaudia/sarcastic-comments-on-reddit) of 1M Reddit comments which were tagged (or not) by the author as sarcastic, evenly split.

This project was originally created in R, for my Data Science Fundamentals class. I have recreated it in Python so I can deploy for your amusement. 

The Python version of this now works. I tested it using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes classifiers. THe original project in R managed to get a 71% score using a Binomial classifier, but the best I have been able to manage in Python has been about 67%, and that's even with some tuning of hyperparameters and increasing the sample size four fold.

To Do:
- ~~Get it working in Python.~~. 
- ~~Test multiple classifiers.~~. 
- ~~Create a web app that takes a sentence and returns a prediction.~~.  
- ~~Deploy to the web (Heroku? Colab?)~~. 
- Refactor this really ugly code, in accordance with Django best practices
